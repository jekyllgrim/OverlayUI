GZDoom library for drawing weapon sprites in UI context to bypass ticrate limitations

GZDoom ZScript library, originally by [Lewisk3](https://github.com/Lewisk3), expanded by Agent_Ash aka jekyllgrim. 

Allows drawing weapon sprite animations in UI context with a customframerate, bypassing standard ticrate limitations, allowing to create high-framerate animations.

EXPERIMENTAL. May cause desyncs in multiplayer. Missing some important functionality.
